Results toolbox for Matlab (version 1.8)
Results toolbox for Python (version 1.0)

This toolbox is a general toolbox for Matlab that should make it simpler
to collect experimental results, annotate them, plot/print/show them in
countless formats (like graphs, text tables, latex tables, html tables,
bar graphs, surface graphs) and store them.

For this a new Matlab object 'results' is created. The idea of the
results-object is:
1. To extend the Matlab matrix with 'feature annotations', such that
   printing a matrix also shows the meaning of each row and column
2. To be able to print the content of a matrix consistently in
   different formats (like text, latex, html, in a graph, etc)
3. To extend the averaging over a dimension such that significantly
   different entries in a matrix are highlighted, and such that
   missing values (=NaN's) are handled correctly

The results-object should be as similar as possible to the standard
Matlab matrix object ('double').

- Installation

Unzip the file, store the contents in a directory (name it for instance
restools) and add this directory to your Matlab path.

- Information and example code

For the most basic information, type 'help restools'. At the end of this
text some example scripts are listed that show the possibilities of this
toolbox.

* Notes on version 1.8.0
- Made a port to Python. Reshuffled the code and made two subdirectories
  to accomodate for that.

* Notes on version 1.7.0
- Added the errorband.m
- Added the semibar, a semi-transparant bar plot.

* Notes on version 1.7.0
- Allowed the use of numerical values along the dimensions. This makes
  it possible to make two types of graphs: one where the values are
  (equidistant) labels, the other where you have arbitrary numerical values.
- Some more sensible warnings, and removed some warnings.


* Notes on version 1.6.2
- Removed a tiny bug in sum.m

* Notes on version 1.6.1
- Make an extra check to see if the ANSI codes can work (i.e. if you are
  working on a java desktop, then it does not work)
- Added the updateresults, where a single entry in the results can be
  updated
- Added the sortdim, so that results can be (alphabetically) ordered

* Notes on version 1.5.3
- The code is now available for other people, so some extra help and
  examples are provided.
- The functions log() and exp() are overloaded for results.

* Note on previous versions (1.5.2 and earlier):
- It is personal code, and I did not maintain a history.

TODO
- Add a user-data, maybe, but is it really necessary? (It is added
  complexity)
